# FizzBuzz Spring Boot Project

Program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”. This must be developed using TDD.

## Notice

Is needed to say that current problem can be solved in a simpler way (single method); but for training purposes TDD was used, among patterns and other Java best practices.

java -jar maya-fizzbuzz.jar
